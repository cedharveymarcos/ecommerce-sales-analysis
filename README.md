**Run LLM on your Mac!** An all-in-one LLMs chat Web UI based on the MLX framework, designed for Apple Silicon.

The idea of chat-with-mlx comes from [qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx).

chat-with-mlx provides a similar and more modern experience, and offers more features.

You can **upload files**, or even **images** to chat when using the vision model.

You can also use the **reasoning model** and see the model's reasoning process.

Also supports online LLM using OpenAI API compatible

If this helps you, I'd be happy if you could give me a star, thank you. âœ¨

## How to use

### Installation

1. Install using pip:
   ```bash
   python -m venv chat-with-mlx
   cd chat-with-mlx
   . ./bin/activate
   pip install git+https://github.com/NeptuneIsTheBest/chat-with-mlx.git
   ```

### Run

   chat-with-mlx
   ```

- `--port`: The port on which the server will run (default is `7860`).
- `--share`: If specified, the server will be shared publicly.

### Use

3. Use in browser: By default, a page will open, http://127.0.0.1:7860, where you can chat.

### Model Configuration

You no longer need to add models by manually editing configuration files, you only need to use the "Model Management" page to add your models.

You can add various models from [mlx-community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community). Models will be automatically downloaded from HuggingFace.

For the following configuration files, the model files will be stored in `models/models/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit`.

**Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit.json**

```json
{
  "original_repo": "mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410",
  "mlx_repo": "mlx-community/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-4bit",

  "quantize": "4bit",
  "default_language": "multi",
  "system_prompt": "",
  "multimodal_ability": []
}
```

- `original_repo`: The original repository where the model can be found.
- `mlx_repo`: The repository in the MLX community.
- `model_name`: The name of the model.
- `quantize`: The quantization format of the model (e.g., `4bit`).
- `default_language`: Default language setting (e.g., `multi` for multilingual support).
